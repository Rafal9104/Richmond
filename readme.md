# Project Richmond

Project Richmond is a website of the fictional football team AFC Richmond from the AppleTV show called "Ted Lasso". In my version, this team plays at the non-league level, which explains why their website doesn't look like websites of big Premier League clubs. This project is my first website ever created.

## Home

The main page of the website features a logo and a navigation menu at the top. The available pages to visit are:

- Home (main page)
- Scores and Table
- Team
- Tickets
- Contact Us

If you scroll down the main page, you'll see layouts with news and articles, organized into a three-column layout. 

## Scores and Table

The Scores and Table page allows users to check the updated league table, latest scores, and upcoming games with dates and times.

## Team

The Team page consists of an image and a list of team members with important information about each player.

## Tickets

The Tickets page allows users to sign up for membership and provides information about ticket prices.

## Contact Us

The Contact Us page allows users to send feedback.

At the bottom of the website, there is a footer that consists of links to social media platforms.
